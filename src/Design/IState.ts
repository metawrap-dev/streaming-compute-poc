 * Defines the fundamental state of an element within the system, particularly focusing on its resolution status.

 * whether an element has completed its initialization, loading, or any processing it needs to become fully operational.
 * This interface can be extended to include additional state properties as needed for more complex scenarios.
 *
 * The `Resolved` property acts as a flag indicating whether the element has reached a state where it requires
 * no further processing to fulfill its role. This is particularly useful for asynchronous operations, where
 * knowing the resolution status of an element can determine the flow of operations or data processing.
